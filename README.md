# The Static Web: JavaScript Milestone Challenge
## Instructions

Create a `tree` function that should build a pine tree out of a character in the Chrome dev tools console. 

### It accepts a single object as an argument. The object has two key/value pairs. One is height and a number from the user, the other is character and a keyboard character from the user.

Once the user enters in a number, and a character, the user can either then just press the enter key _(as long as the cursor is in one of the input fields)_, or click a button that is labeled "Grow your tree" and the tree will be shown in the console. 

If either of the input fields does not have a value in it when the user presses the enter key, or presses the button, an alert displays stating that both fields must have a value.



##### Example

Here's what the pine tree should look like when you specify a height of 7, and use the asterisk character.

```js
      *
     ***
    *****
   *******
  *********
 ***********
*************
```
